    Each inclusion uses regular expression pattern matching, and must be separated by a new line.
    An empty list implies that everything is included.
    <p/>
  <pre>
	myapp/src/main/web/.*\.html
	myapp/src/main/web/.*\.jpeg
	myapp/src/main/web/.*\.gif
  </pre>
    The example above illustrates that a build will only occur, if html/jpeg/gif files
    have been committed to the GitHub repository. Exclusions take precedence over
    inclusions, if there is an overlap between included and excluded regions.

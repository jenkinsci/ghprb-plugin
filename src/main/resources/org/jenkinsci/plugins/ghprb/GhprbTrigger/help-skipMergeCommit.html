    GitHub provides a merge commit against the target branch that can be used for builds.
    If the target branch is updated, the merge commit for the PR will change, which can
    cause git clone errors in some cases. Checking this option ignores GitHub's merge commit,
    and instead uses the commit that is on the pull request branch.

    Checking this option will disable regular polling (cron) for changes in GitHub
    and will try to create a GitHub hook. Creating a GitHub hook requires that the user
    which is specified in the <em>GitHub Pull Request Builder</em> configuration has
    admin rights to the specified repository.<br/>
    If you want to create a hook manually set it for event types:
    <code>issue_comment</code>, <code>pull_request</code>
    and url <code>http://yourserver.com/jenkins/ghprbhook/</code>.<br/>
    Your Jenkins server must be accessible from internet.

	Checking this option will disable regular polling (cron) for changes in GitHub
	and will try to create a GitHub hook. Creating a GitHub hook requires that the user
	which is specified in the <em>GitHub Pull Request Builder</em> configuration has
	admin rights to the specified repository.<br/>
	By default, GitHub hooks created this way will have SSL certificate verification enabled.
	To disable SSL certificate verification in these GitHub hooks, start Jenkins with system
	property <code>org.jenkinsci.plugins.ghprb.GhprbRepository.webhook.insecure</code> set
	to <code>true</code>.<br/>
	If you want to create a hook manually set it for event types:
		<code>issue_comment</code>,	<code>pull_request</code>
	and url <code>< your jenkins server url >/ghprbhook/</code>.  The url should be composed of your full jenkins server url plus
	the ending <code>/ghprbhook/</code> path.  If your jenkins server is just a domain like https://jenkins.yourcompany.com then the url would look like 
	https://jenkins.yourcompany.com/ghprbhook/.  If your jenkins server is accessed at a path off of a domain like https://yourcompany.com/jenkins 
	then the url would look like https://yourcompany.com/jenkins/ghprbhook/<br/>.  
	Your Jenkins server must be accessible from internet.

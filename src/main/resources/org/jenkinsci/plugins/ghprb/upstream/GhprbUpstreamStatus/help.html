<div>
    Allows you to set a custom context and message on a pull request pulled using GHPRB.
    <br/> This will add the context and message to the pull request found in the upstream job NOT on any pull requests
    taken on this job
    <br/> To add a custom context and message on any pull requests on THIS job see the GHPRB section in the Build
    Triggers section
    <br/>
    <br/>IMPORTANT:
    <br/>This will only work if you configure a upstream job that uses the Github Pull Request Builder Plugin
